/**
 * Checks for "lint" in the selected file by running an appropriate external program.
 * There's no fundamental reason why the user couldn't just add their own external tool definitions, but:
 * 1. things that work out of the box are always preferable, and most users won't know about external tools, and fewer still will define any.
 * 2. most users are likely to use more than one language, and if they need a lint checker for each language, all those tools would be unwieldy (as I found).
 * 3. it's not currently sensible (nor is it likely to become so) to assign the same keyboard equivalent to multiple tools, and suitable keys are in short supply.
 * 4. this lets us add a bit of post-processing, so we can massage tidy(1) output into more useful grep(1)-style output, for example.
 * 5. a built-in lint checking system also lets us provide a fancier interface in future, even though it's currently no better than a user-defined external tool.
 * The major disadvantage (ignoring "more code") is that we're still likely to want some local configuration mechanism (for domain-specific languages, say, or because you prefer an alternative to the tool we suggest, or because you have access to a special tool).
 * 
 * Regarding a possible future "fancier interface", "pyflakes" is a very fast checker for Python, and "ruby -wc" and "tidy -qe" are already very quick.
 * Checking as-you-type sounds eminently possible, even without the ability to use any of these in-process.
